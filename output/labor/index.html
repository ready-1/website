<p><em>Effective January 1, 2024 until further notice.</em></p>
<p><a href="/pdfs/ready-1-labor-and-travel-policy-20240101.pdf">Downloadable PDF</a> - Click here for a downloadable PDF</p>
<h3>IN TOWN LABOR</h3>
<p>In town labor is considered any work performed within 30 miles of Dade City, FL.</p>
<h3>OUT-OF-TOWN LABOR</h3>
<p>Out of town labor is considered any work performed more than 30 miles away from Dade City, FL. Other than travel days, half days are not applicable to out-of-town shows. Half-day travel must be negotiated in advance. Dark days are billable on out-of-town shows.</p>
<h3>CONUS LABOR</h3>
<p>CONUS labor is considered any work performed inside the contiguous 48 states.</p>
<h3>INTERNATIONAL LABOR</h3>
<p>International labor is considered to be any work performed outside the contiguous 48 states.</p>
<h3>DAY RATES</h3>
<p>Day rates are based on a 10-hour day. Certain positions (where noted) may be based on an 8-hour day.</p>
<h3>SPLIT CALL (IN-TOWN ONLY – WHERE APPLICABLE) (NON-UNION)</h3>
<p>A split call is two half-day calls, separated by at least six (6) hours.</p>
<h3>MEAL BREAKS</h3>
<p>If negotiated in advance, meal breaks are taken off the technician’s hours, provided the break is at least one hour long, suitable food outlets are within pragmatic walking distance and the technician is allowed to leave the work site. Meal breaks are only taken in one-hour increments and partial hours for meal breaks are not taken off the total hours submitted. If meal breaks are negotiated, a maximum of one meal break per shift will be taken unpaid.</p>
<h3>OVERTIME</h3>
<p>Overtime is billed for any work performed beyond ten (10) and up to twelve (12) hours, excluding one meal break (if applicable). Overtime is billed at 1.5 times the hourly rate.</p>
<h3>DOUBLE TIME</h3>
<p>Double time is billed for any work performed beyond twelve (12) hours a day, excluding one meal break (if applicable). Double time is billed at 2.0 times the hourly rate. Double time is billed for any hours worked between midnight and 5am. Double time is billed for the first five (5) hours of any call time starting between midnight and 5am; the next five (5) hours are billed at the straight time rate. After ten (10) hours the technician is billed at the overtime rate. After twelve (12) hours worked, the technician is billed at the double time rate.</p>
<h3>TURNAROUND</h3>
<p>If a technician gets less than eight (8) but more than four (4) hours off between call times, the technician will be in turnaround and will return at the overtime rate for the next shift. The technician will remain on overtime for the entire shift unless they go into double time as detailed above. Turnaround will be in effect until the technician is given at least eight (8) hours off.</p>
<h3>REMAINDER OF SHIFT</h3>
<p>If the technician is released prior to the end of the shift while on Overtime or Double time the remaining time will be billed at Straight time.</p>
<h3>CONTINUOUS PAY</h3>
<p>If a technician gets less than six (6) hours off between shifts, the hours will be billed straight through continuously.</p>
<h3>HOLIDAYS</h3>
<p>All holidays (New Year’s Day, Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas) are billed as full days at the overtime rate, with double time after ten (10) hours.</p>
<h3>PER DIEM</h3>
<p>Per diem is required to be paid to the technician per day for all out of town shows regardless of whether or not meals are provided at the show site. Per diem amount is the US GSA rate for CONUS locations and the US Department of State rate for all other locations. Per diem rates will be as published on the GSA/Dept. of State websites for the dates traveled.  All per diem will be billed at the full day rate.</p>
<h3>AIR TRAVEL</h3>
<p>The client is solely responsible for covering all air travel expenses for Ready-1 personnel. Ready-1 will recommend preferred flight options that account for circumstances external to the client’s immediate considerations, such as logistical complexities or event scheduling. For any air travel that exceeds two hours total gate-to-gate time, first-class or business-class seats must be booked unless such seats are unavailable for purchase on the day of travel within a reasonably accommodating schedule. Whenever possible, the Ready-1 technician’s preferred airline should be used.</p>
<h3>HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS (IN-TOWN)</h3>
<p>Unless negotiated in advance, hotel accommodations for technicians will be required for events that end between the hours of midnight and 6:00 am.  Hotel accommodations may be required if traveling from the worksite will cause conditions deemed to be unsafe for the technician due to fatigue, weather, travel, or other aggravating factors.</p>
<h3>HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS (OUT-OF-TOWN)</h3>
<p>The Client is required to provide a separate hotel room for each Ready-1 technician. If a room is not provided in the same hotel as the show, the time it takes the technician to arrive will be added to the technician’s total hours for that day and will count toward overtime.</p>
<h3>TRAVEL DAYS</h3>
<p>A travel day is billed for travel to and from an out-of-town show. Travel is based on a full day rate (10 hours). An outbound air travel day begins 2 hours prior to the scheduled departure time and ends when the technician arrives on site and after any required work is done. A return air travel day begins two (2) hours prior to the scheduled departure time and ends one (1) hour after the actual arrival time. All non-air travel days are billed door-to-door in whole hour increments.  Travel in excess of 10 hours due to any air or ground transportation delays is billable. Any ground transportation, tolls, tips or other incidentals are billable. All hours begin and end according to the time zone from which the technician originates.</p>
<h3>HEALTH / VACCINATION COMPLIANCE</h3>
<p>If health / medical testing is required and the test can be conducted at the technician's home or place of lodging, receipts will be submitted for the cost of the test.  If the test requires a technician to travel to a testing site, charges for the cost of the test and 250.00USD time and travel will be invoiced for each test required.  If PPE is required on the job site and not provided by production, there will be a charge of 25.00USD per technician for each day PPE is required.</p>
<p>Vaccination requirements must be stipulated at least 30 days prior to travel plus the time required for vaccine efficacy in order to ensure compliance.</p>
<h3>SECURITY</h3>
<h4>Client Responsibilities</h4>
<p>The client is solely responsible for the protection, security, and safekeeping of all equipment and personnel while on-site, including during travel, transportation and storage.

<p>In circumstances where the safety and security risks are heightened, the client may be required to provide:</p>
<ul>

<li><strong>Secured Transportation</strong>: The client is responsible for providing secure and appropriate transportation if the risk assessment deems it necessary (e.g., armored vehicles or security escorts).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Liability</h4>
<p>The client acknowledges and agrees that Ready-1 will not be held liable for any loss, damage, or harm to the equipment or personnel arising from any of the above risks. The client accepts all associated risks and agrees to cover the costs of any repairs, replacements, or compensation resulting from damage, loss, or injury.</p>
<h3>VARIANCES</h3>
