# About Ready-1 Event Support

At **Ready-1 Event Support**, we handle the broadcast engineering for complex corporate live events. We specialize in **multi-camera setups**, **networking and control**, and **color management**. Our goal is simple: bring the best of modern broadcast techniques to the corporate world, making sure everything looks great and runs smoothly.

## Our Story

Founded by an industry veteran with decades of hands-on experience, Ready-1 Event Support was born out of a desire to push the boundaries of live event production. Having worked for some of the largest production and rental companies in North America, our founder felt it was time to step out independently and deliver an unmatched level of technical expertise to corporate events.

From humble beginnings as a "sound guy" in a small church in 1983, to working for major regional rental shops and even cruise ships, our journey has been shaped by years of learning and adapting. Over time, we have grown to work with some of the largest rental houses in the US—both as an employee and a contractor.

## Our Mission

We're passionate about sharing the insights and skills that have shaped our work, especially for engineers and technicians eager to elevate their craft.  Our website serves as a **landing page** for industry professionals to find us and as a **repository of knowledge** for those interested in learning more about the intricate world of broadcast engineering. 

## Core Values

At Ready-1 Event Support, we are guided by a set of key values that ensure we deliver consistent, high-quality results:

1. **Cash before the downbeat**: We believe in full transparency. There’s no room for ambiguity—every aspect of the job is clear before we begin.
2. **The show must go on**: Once we step onto the site, the event takes precedence. Surprises are a failure of preparation.
3. **Load in for the load-out**: Every decision we make is about efficiency and foresight—thinking through the process to ensure smooth transitions.
4. **Bad news never gets better with age**: Sometimes "no" is the best answer, and being upfront is the key to success.
5. **It’s OK to ask for help**: We foster a learning environment. If you don’t know something, ask. It’s how we grow.
6. **No assholes allowed**: A basic rule of life—respect for others and professionalism at all times.
7. **Denis Phillips' Rule #7**: _Stop freaking out... until I tell you to._ Stay calm and focused, no matter the situation. Panic solves nothing; composure and adaptability are what keep the show on track.

## Our Unique Approach

What sets us apart from others is our deep understanding of **full chain color management** and how lighting design fundamentally impacts the success of an event. Our expertise doesn’t stop at just running the show—we help ensure every visual element comes together to create an on-trend, polished look that stands out in an increasingly competitive online landscape.

We bring a modern broadcast approach, marrying old-school cinematography techniques with cutting-edge technology to give corporate events a look that rivals high-quality productions, not outdated television.

## Who We Serve

Our services are tailored to **technical directors, producers, and project managers** who require precise technical execution for their events. We also offer educational insights for other engineers and technicians interested in learning the nuances of event broadcast engineering.

## Looking Ahead

Our long-term vision is to grow Ready-1 Event Support into a platform for sharing knowledge. We aim to create a repository of information that others in the field can use to sharpen their skills. We also hope to be more involved in the **planning stages** of events, particularly in areas like **color management**, **lighting design**, and **set design**—bringing our technical expertise into the creative process.

Additionally, we want to support the next generation of engineers by offering guidance and education to those eager to learn the craft of event engineering.

## Personal Touch

Outside of work, we love to explore new places, meet different cultures, and savor new culinary experiences. And, of course, a good bourbon never hurts after a long day on the job.
